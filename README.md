# Kassprix
Kassprix is an e-commerce mobile app that allows users to make a purchase of our products mainly in categories like food, clothing, shoes, makeup, cleaning products, Electronic devices and also gardening products. It has been developed on Android Studio platform using java programming language. It also has 2 interactive tools such as camera to set real time photo as profile picture and a speech to text feature to easily search for products found on the kassprix firebase. This project was developed for my year 2 Software Engineering Interactive System Design class assignment.
